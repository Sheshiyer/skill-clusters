# Selemene Report — `/selemene-report`

Generate Selemene Engine reports from a coding-agent context.

This skill is a thin orchestrator over surfaces that already exist in the repo:

- **Deterministic reports** — birth chart, compatibility, transit — via the Rust `noesis-vedic-api` report generator, reached through the `@selemene/bridge` CLI.
- **Narrative witness readings** — solo or dyadic — via `packages/witness-pipeline/src/orchestrator/integrated.ts`.

The skill does not reimplement report logic. It asks for missing inputs, invokes the right existing path, writes a manifest + artifact, and returns the artifact path plus a non-prescriptive witness prompt.

---

## Triggers

Invoke this skill when the user says any of the following, or asks for a Selemene report without specifying a surface:

- `/selemene-report`
- `selemene report`
- `generate selemene report`
- `birth chart report`
- `compatibility report`
- `transit report`
- `witness reading`
- `selemene reading`

## Non-triggers (route elsewhere)

- Building or modifying a Selemene engine → `rust-orchestrator` or `backend-architecture-orchestrator`
- Changing the bridge CLI itself → `createcli` or work directly in `bridges/cli/src/`
- Human-facing web intake → the existing `apps/noesis-web` app; this skill is for agent/terminal use
- PDF/DOCX layout/rendering → `documents` cluster (`docx`, `pdf`, `notebooklm`)

---

## Inputs

The skill accepts a command string and resolves the report type from the first positional argument.

### Deterministic reports

```bash
/selemene-report birth "Name" "1990-01-15T10:30:00+05:30" "Bangalore" \
  [--output-dir ./selemene-reports] [--format text|html|json|pdf]

/selemene-report compatibility \
  --person1 "Name A" "1990-01-15T10:30:00+05:30" "Bangalore" \
  --person2 "Name B" "1992-03-20T14:00:00+05:30" "Mumbai" \
  [--output-dir ./selemene-reports]

/selemene-report transit "Name" "1990-01-15T10:30:00+05:30" "Bangalore" \
  --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-12-31 \
  [--output-dir ./selemene-reports]
```

### Narrative witness reading

```bash
/selemene-report witness --mode solo --subjects subjects.json \
  [--level L1|L2|L3|L4|L5] [--output-dir ./selemene-reports]
```

`subjects.json` matches the existing `ReportSubjectInput` shape from `packages/witness-pipeline/src/intake/types.ts`:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "primary",
    "name": "Name",
    "birth_date": "1990-01-15",
    "birth_time": "10:30",
    "birth_time_confidence": "exact",
    "birth_location_query": "Bangalore"
  }
]
```

### Environment

The skill reads the same environment the bridge CLI uses:

- `SELEMENE_RUST_URL` (default: `http://localhost:8080`)
- `SELEMENE_TS_URL` (default: `http://localhost:3001`)
- `SELEMENE_API_KEY` (optional)
- `SELEMENE_OUTPUT_DIR` (default: `./selemene-reports`)

It also respects a local `.selemenerc.json` if present, reusing the bridge config file format.

---

## Execution flow

1. **Parse intent** — first positional argument chooses one of `birth`, `compatibility`, `transit`, `witness`.
2. **Validate inputs** — require birth datetime + location for deterministic reports; require `--subjects` JSON for witness.
3. **Resolve backend**
   - Deterministic: call `npx @selemene/bridge generate` first if tool definitions are stale, then `POST` to the relevant Rust OpenAPI workflow endpoint (`/api/v1/workflows/birth-report/execute`, `/api/v1/workflows/compatibility-report/execute`, `/api/v1/workflows/transit-report/execute`). The actual Selemene repo does not expose dedicated `/api/reports/*` routes; deterministic reports are produced by executing the corresponding workflows.
    - Witness: the `packages/witness-pipeline` package is a TypeScript library (not an HTTP server). The running `ts-engines` server exposes generic engine endpoints (`/engines/:id/calculate`), not a dedicated witness endpoint. The live equivalent for assembled witness readings is the Rust `POST /api/v1/assets/generate` endpoint.
4. **Write artifacts** — always emit:
   - `{output_dir}/manifest.json`
   - `{output_dir}/{report_type}-{slug}-{timestamp}.{ext}`
5. **Return result** — absolute artifact path + a one-line witness prompt.

---

## Output contract

Every run produces a manifest next to the artifact:

```json
{
  "report_type": "birth|compatibility|transit|witness",
  "created_at": "2026-07-06T13:45:00Z",
  "subject_count": 1,
  "engines_used": ["vedic"],
  "artifact_path": "/abs/path/to/selemene-reports/birth-name-20260706-134500.md",
  "witness_prompt": "What is the one thing from this report that feels most alive right now?"
}
```

For deterministic reports the artifact format is set by `--format`. For witness readings the artifact is markdown by default, matching the source-pack factory output in `packages/witness-pipeline/src/assets/factory.ts`.

---

## Tool reference

The skill ships a thin wrapper in `Tools/` that performs the parse → validate → invoke → write flow.

- `Tools/Report.ts` — main entry, called as `bun run Tools/Report.ts <subcommand> <args>`
- `Tools/lib/resolve-config.ts` — reads `.selemenerc.json` and env vars
- `Tools/lib/write-manifest.ts` — writes the manifest.json contract
- `Tools/lib/prompts.ts` — returns a witness prompt per report type

Do not edit `Tools/` to add new report math. If a report type is missing, extend the backend (Rust or witness-pipeline) first, then add a sub-command mapping here.

---

## Verification checklist

Before claiming a report was generated:

- [ ] The manifest file exists next to the artifact and is valid JSON.
- [ ] The artifact file exists and is non-empty.
- [ ] The backend endpoint or witness-pipeline script returned a success status.
- [ ] The returned path is absolute and readable.

---

### Running the backend

Start the Rust API server from the Selemene Engine repo:

```bash
cd /Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/01-Projects/tryambakam-noesis/Selemene-engine
export RUST_ENV=development
export CF_DEV_BYPASS_TOKEN=selemene-local-test
export ENABLE_SWAGGER_UI=true
cargo run -p noesis-api --bin noesis-server
```

Notes:
- The crate is `noesis-api` and the binary name is `noesis-server` (`cargo run -p noesis-api` alone is ambiguous because the crate also ships helper binaries).
- Default bind address is `0.0.0.0:8080`.
- `CF_DEV_BYPASS_TOKEN` + `x-noesis-dev-auth` header bypasses auth in development only; production requires a valid JWT or `X-API-Key`.
- `ENABLE_SWAGGER_UI=true` exposes `/api/openapi.json` and `/api/docs`.
- Without `DATABASE_URL`, auth endpoints are unavailable but health checks and workflow execution via dev bypass still work.

Verify health:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/health/live
```

Expected: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` with JSON body containing `status`, `version`, `uptime_seconds`, `engines_loaded`, and `workflows_loaded`.

### TypeScript engines server

Start the TypeScript engine server from the Selemene Engine repo:

```bash
cd /Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/01-Projects/tryambakam-noesis/Selemene-engine/ts-engines
bun run dev
```

Notes:
- Default bind address is `0.0.0.0:3001`.
- This is a generic Elysia API for the TS consciousness engines (`tarot`, `i-ching`, `enneagram`, `sacred-geometry`, `sigil-forge`, `raaga`).
- It does **not** expose `/witness/generate`; witness-pipeline is a local library.

Verify health:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:3001/health
```

Expected: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` with JSON body containing `status`, `engines`, `uptime_ms`, and `version`.

## Endpoint assumptions

- Rust deterministic reports: `POST {rustUrl}/api/v1/workflows/{birth-blueprint|daily-practice|decision-support|self-inquiry|creative-expression|full-spectrum}/execute`.
  - The actual running server exposes these workflow IDs: `birth-blueprint`, `daily-practice`, `decision-support`, `self-inquiry`, `creative-expression`, `full-spectrum`.
  - There is **no** `birth-report`, `compatibility-report`, or `transit-report` workflow; the repo also does not expose dedicated `/api/reports/*` routes.
  - Request body shape is `EngineInput`:
    ```json
    {
      "birth_data": {
        "name": "Ada",
        "date": "1815-12-10",
        "time": "15:00",
        "latitude": 51.5074,
        "longitude": -0.1278,
        "timezone": "Europe/London"
      },
      "options": {}
    }
    ```
    - `current_time` and `precision` are optional (defaults apply).
    - `location` may be used for geo-only engines but chart workflows primarily read `birth_data`.
- Generic workflow execution: `POST {rustUrl}/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/execute` with the same `EngineInput` body.
- TS witness pipeline: there is no `POST {tsUrl}/witness/generate` on the running `ts-engines` server. The only TS HTTP surface is `ts-engines`, which exposes `GET /health`, `/engines`, `/engines/:id/info`, and `POST /engines/:id/calculate`. The witness-pipeline package is a library (`IntegratedReadingOrchestrator`).
- Live witness / premium-asset endpoint: `POST {rustUrl}/api/v1/assets/generate` returns an `AssetGenerateResponse` with `assembled` text.

If your Selemene deployment uses different routes, update `Tools/Report.ts` before using.

## Design notes

- **Hub-and-spoke citizenship.** This skill is an `active-spoke` under the `selemene` cluster. It is enumerated only if the cluster is active; otherwise it resolves on demand via `~/.agents/skill-clusters/skills/selemene-report/SKILL.md`.
- **No duplicate logic.** The skill invokes `@selemene/bridge` and `packages/witness-pipeline`; it does not contain copies of `mergeSpecs`, `generateClaudeTools`, `IntegratedReadingOrchestrator`, or `ReportSection` logic.
- **Non-prescriptive framing.** All returned prompts are mirrors, not advice. This matches the existing witness-pipeline tone.
